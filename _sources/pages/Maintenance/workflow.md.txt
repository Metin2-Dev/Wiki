# Workflow
To keep the flow of development and releases stable, the are some rules
that need to be strictly followed


## Development flow
Any changes from external contributors have to be made in the 
[development repository][dev-repository] via a PR accompanied by
a related issue and a proper discussion to the 'development' branch

If the discussion reaches the consensus about the PR, it then can
be approved, and modified by a maintainer for corrections

If the changes are within the scope of valid reasoning, they will
later pass to the 'beta' branch


## Main release flow
Periodically every two weeks the changes that reside on the development 
repository in the beta branch will be summed and thoroughly reviewed
for official release in the [main repository][main-repository] by
maintainers and the metin2dev team
